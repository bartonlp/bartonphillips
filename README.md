The pages are written in PHP and use my framework [SiteClass](https://github.com/bartonlp/site-class).
The framework provides database access and helpfull methods to simplify the repetitive tasks of providing boiler plates for headers, footers and banners. It also provides methods for hit counting and analysis.
